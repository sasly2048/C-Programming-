# Very Hard Problems (501-1000): System Programming, Advanced Memory Management, Concurrency Concepts, OS-level Simulations

This folder contains **very hard-level C programming problems** that focus on **system-level programming**, **advanced memory handling**, and **OS-level concepts**. 
These problems are designed to challenge your understanding of low-level programming and help you build production-grade coding skills.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- âœ… **System Programming** â€” interacting with the operating system, system calls, process management.
- âœ… **Advanced Memory Management** â€” dynamic allocation strategies, memory leaks detection, custom allocators.
- âœ… **Concurrency Concepts** â€” multi-threading, synchronization (mutex, semaphores), deadlock handling.
- âœ… **OS-level Simulations** â€” simulations of CPU scheduling algorithms, memory paging, file system emulation.


**Warning**: These problems are **challenging** and may require research beyond standard textbooks. Consistent practice and patience will lead to mastery.
