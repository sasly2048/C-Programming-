## 🖥️ **Daily C Programming Practice** 

📌 About This Repository : 

This repository is dedicated to my daily practice of the **C Programming Language**. 
The goal is to consistently improve my understanding of core programming concepts, sharpen problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in C. 
I will be solving small problems, writing utility programs, and implementing various algorithms and data structures.

I will update this table regularly as I progress.

Feel free to explore any folder. Each folder contains:
- `.c` files for programs
- `README.md` (if needed) to explain the day's focus
- Input/output examples and any relevant notes
